Hello! This is my new personal site where I will try to keep my various activities up to date. I am currently Professor of Urban Analytics and Head of Department at the [Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/casa), [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/).  


Some more info will be added soon.
